This is a small project containing an application. The main focus of the application is on encrypting, decrypting and storing users messages.

Main functionalities:
1) Encrypting a message
    - Simple algorithm that randomly moves characters of the message up and down a imported or predefined string and therefore turns the message into a unreadable string.
    - Generates a key which is then used to decrypt the message
    - Can generate a MASTER KEY which is used to encrypt the previously generated key to ensure complete security. This key is supposed to establish a secure communication
      between the two parties involved and it is recommended to transfer this key only through offline channels.
2) Decrypting a message
    - Reverses the encryption algorithm by using the encrypted string and MASTER KEY.
3) Generating MASTER KEY
    - Application is able to generate a MASTER KEY independently and saves it into a local repository of MASTER KEYs.
4) Importing MASTER KEY
    - Application is able to import a MASTER KEY into the local repository and the key can be then used to decrypt/encrypt messages.
5) Key Repository
    - Application uses a temporary key repository where all the MASTER KEYs are stored.

Any operation in the application can be cancelled by typing "exit".
